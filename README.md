# Rasleen's Java Journey 🚀

Hey there! I'm **Rasleen Kaur**, just starting my adventure into the world of **Java programming**. 🎉

This repo is where I upload all the little Java programs I create every day — from simple input exercises to solving random questions and challenges. It's like my digital notebook, but way cooler and on the internet! 😄

Why am I doing this?  
- To track my progress 📈  
- To have a backup and save some space on my computer 💾  
- And because sharing is caring! Maybe someone out there will find these useful.

Feel free to peek around, learn with me, or just say hi! 👋

Happy coding! 💻✨  
— Rasleen
